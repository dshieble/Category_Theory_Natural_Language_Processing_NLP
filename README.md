# Category Theory + NLP (Natural Language Processing)


List of papers and other resources at the intersection of Category Theory and NLP.

Please feel free to PR or email me if you have anything to add - there's much more to put in, will build as I have the time.

This will also be in a public Roam graph when they add more DBs/user.
